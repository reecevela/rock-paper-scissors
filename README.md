Play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer!

In [this project](reecevela.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/index.html), I learned how to tons of things in JavaScript!

- use switch statements and nest them
- create functions
- manipulate contents of HTML elements using JavScript
- use variables in CSS and JavaScript
- use buttons to add functionality to websites!
